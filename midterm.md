Weekly homework will consist of online knowledge assessment quizzes together with pre-class reading and video screen-casts. 

Specific grading criteria (assessment rubrics) will be given at the time of assignment. Weekly grades will returned to students via email. Each student is responsible for checking to ensure that a grade has been entered for their submissions. Documents submitted by email do not always arrive at their intended destination and late submissions will not be accepted after one week past the original due date. Collectively homework performance will account for 35% of the course grade.


## Mid term: Find a gene project assignment:  
A total of 20% of the course grade will be assigned based on the mid-term. The purpose of this assignment is for you to grasp the principles of database searching, sequence analysis and functional annotation that we cover in the course.
